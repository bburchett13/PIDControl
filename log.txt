The goal for today was to start the project. I built the github repository, threw in an HTML header, and started on learning plotly. 
I will be using plotly to make my plots for this project. This is primarily because the documentation seems approachable and I feel 
that I can learn it with relative ease. I learned enough to make a step plot and put it in the body of the HTML which is a start. 
This means that I can start on the controller. Next time I log in, that is what I will be playing with.

I implemented a bang bang controller successfully and started on PID. It's been a long time since I've looked at PID control and the
last time I did so, I used MATLAB. Because I'm in Javascript, I'm attempting to discretize the PID controller, which has given me
some trouble. I have a 2 different versions in the code currently. Both seem to work slightly differently, and neither performs how
I expect. I'll need to do some more research on this. Once I get the controller working, I'm planning to edit the HTML to add in
buttons that allow me to do everything from the webpage. One step at a time though...

I figured out that the system wasn't working properly, because I was directly controlling the output. Not controlling a variable
within a system. Whoops. I guess the rust is showing with my controls knowledge. When doing a simple P = Vt system and controlling
the velocity, I get a much more logical response. I still have things to fix with both the P control (I have no steady 
state error), and the D control (it provides an instant response and then no added effect, or it makes the system unstable), but 
we're much closer. This is a good stopping point for now.

So I figured it out. I have a working system with working PID control. I can do a step input, a ramp input, a sine wave, and all
reference functions work properly. The issue was all in how I defined my system, not in how I implemented PID. Turns out,
if your system isn't defined properly, it doesn't matter how well your controller works. I've pivoted to a boiler/chiller system,
which seems to work pretty well. I also cleaned up the code and added comments to improve the readability of my code. Now I'm 
ready to start adding buttons to the webpage and making it look nice and pretty.

I added in the buttons on the webpage so the whole thing can be run from there. No more changing hardcoded variable values! This 
also makes it easier to switch input types. I could add colors and such, but I'm happy with this as is. You can also turn off PID
completely and experiment with a bang-bang controller. I made it so that the bang bang controller can only change directions every
.05 seconds, so it can't react instantly. This helps to better show the oscillations that are caused by bang bang controllers. 
There are still things that I could add to this project, but I am happy with it where it is now. I am going to move on to my next
project for now, but may revisit later.
